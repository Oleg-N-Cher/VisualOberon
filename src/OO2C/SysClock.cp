   local time.

   Note 1: On most Unix systems the time zone information is only available for
   dates falling within approximately @samp{1 Jan 1902} to @samp{31 Dec 2037}.
   Outside this range the field @ofield{c.zone} will be set to the unspecified
   @oconst{localTime} value, and @ofield{c.summerTimeFlag} will be set to
   @oconst{unknown}.

   Note 2: The time zone information might not be fully accurate for past (and
   future) years that apply different DST rules than the current year.  Usually
   the current set of rules is used for @emph{all} years between 1902 and 2037.

   Note 3: With DST there is one hour in the year that happens twice: the hour
   after which the clock is turned back for a full hour.  It is undefined which
   time zone will be selected for dates refering to this hour, that is, whether
   DST or normal time zone will be chosen.  *)

PROCEDURE- GetTimeOfDay* (VAR sec, usec: INTEGER): INTEGER;

   Equivalent to the C function `gettimeofday'.  The return value is `0' on

   zero.  *)
