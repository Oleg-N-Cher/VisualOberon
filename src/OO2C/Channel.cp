(**The module defines the abstract data types @otype{Channel}, @otype{Reader},
   and @otype{Writer} for stream I/O.

   Note 0: All types and procedures declared in this module have to be
   considered abstract, i.e., they are never instanciated or called.  The
   provided procedure bodies are nothing but hints how a specific channel could
   start implementing them.

   Note 1: A module implementing specific channels (e.g., files, or TCP
   streams) will provide the procedures

   @example
   PROCEDURE New* (...): Channel;
   @end example

   and (optionally)

   @example
   PROCEDURE Old* (...): Channel.
   @end example

   For channels that correspond to a piece of data that can be both read and
   changed, the first procedure will create a new channel for the given data
   location, deleting all data previously contained in it.  The latter will
   open a channel to the existing data.

   For channels representing a unidirectional byte stream (like output to /
   input from terminal, or a TCP stream), only a procedure @samp{New} is
   provided.  It will create a connection with the designated location.

   The formal parameters of these procedures will include some kind of
   reference to the data being opened (for example, a file name) and,
   optionally, flags that modify the way the channel is opened (for example
   read-only, write-only, etc).  Their interface therefore depends on the
   channel and is not part of this specification.

   Note 2: A channel implementation should state how many channels can be open
   simultaneously.  It's common for the OS to support just so many open files
   or so many open sockets at the same time.  Since this value isn't a
   constant, it's only required to give a statement on the number of open
   connections for the best case, and which factors can lower this number.

   Note 3: A number of record fields in @samp{Channel}, @samp{Reader}, and
   @samp{Writer} are exported with write permissions.  This is done to permit
   specializations of the classes to change these fields.  The user should
   consider them read-only.

   Note: The list of error codes defined in this module only covers the most
   typical errors.  A specific channel implementation (like @omodule{*Files})
   will define its own list own codes, containing aliases for the codes below
   (when appropriate) plus error codes of its own.  Every module will provide
   an error context (an instance of @otype{Msg.Context}) to translate any code
   into a human readable message.  *)

PROCEDURE (ch: Channel) Flush*, NEW, ABSTRACT;
(**Flushes all buffers related to this channel.  Any pending write operations
   are passed to the underlying OS and all buffers are marked as invalid.  The
   next read operation will get its data directly from the channel instead of
   the buffer.  If a writing error occurs during flushing, the field
   @ofield{ch.res} will be changed to @oconst{writeError}, otherwise it's
   assigned @oconst{done}.  Note that you have to check the channel's
   @ofield{Channel.res} flag after an explicit flush yourself, since none of
   the attached writers will notice any write error in this case.  *)

  BEGIN
    (* ... *)

PROCEDURE (ch: Channel) Close*, NEW, ABSTRACT;
(**Flushes all buffers associated with @oparam{ch}, closes the channel, and
   frees all system resources allocated to it.  This invalidates all riders
   attached to @oparam{ch}, and they can't be used further.  On success,
   i.e. if all read and write operations (including flush) completed
   successfully, @ofield{ch.res} is set to @oconst{done}.  An opened channel
   can only be closed once, successive calls of @oproc{Channel.Close} are
   undefined.  Note that unlike the Oberon System all opened channels have to
   be closed explicitly.  Otherwise resources allocated to them will remain
   blocked.  *)

  BEGIN
    ch. Flush;

      (* ... *)
