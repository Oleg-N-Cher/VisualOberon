MODULE VO:Base:Object [OOC_EXTENSIONS];

  (**
    Implements @otype{Object} the  baseclass for all VisualOberon objects.
    Does also define the derived class @otype{MsgObject} which implements
    message communication between @otype{Object}s. @otype{Model}, the baseclass
    for all models, is also implemented here.

                          You simply insert a handler between sender reciever that
