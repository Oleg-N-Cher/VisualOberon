* LongStrings.Capitalize cannot be implemented using the internal
  CAP function - it does not work for Unicode strings. We need to provide
  an OS system function call for this task.

* SysClock.c uses the function geteuid() to know can we set clock.
  Under Windows there is no implementation of this function, so we have
  to find out if we have the admin privileges in other way.
